>R is approximately 30 years old. Why does that matter? 
>
>Think about an old car for a second, like the Ford Model T. For the most part it does everything a car should do. It seats 2 or 4. It has a windshield. It has tires and it goes 30 miles per hour. R is no different. It is simple to use. It is simple to understand.
