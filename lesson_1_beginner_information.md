## Course 1: Beginner Information

**NOTE: This first course is intended as a very basic intro to R**

{Lesson / Content & Script for each lesson}

1. Are you Math-Phobic?
    - Hi My name is Matt Curcio and I love playing with numbers. 
    - I am biochemist by training but then I later became a grade-school teacher for ten years. But I am not a computer scientist or a mathematician.

    - When I taught 10-12 yr olds, I realized that many people have a difficult relationship with math. My kids were no different.
    - When I got push-back teaching math, I would explain math this way.
	- *Math is like a NEW language.*
	- *AND just like ANY new language you doesn't come to you right away. 
	- *It takes time to learn the vocabulary and how to operate like a thoughtful person.*
	- *No one gets a language immediately.*
	- However, we all expect Math to be like English class.
	- English was easy by comparison, **because** we already had a big jump on it. 
	- My fourth graders had a 10 year of head start on English.
	- 
    - Another thing I realized was that Math was mostly taught by people who did not use it on a day to day basis. 
    - Consider a mitre saw for a second. If I am not a carpenter I may not understand the great things I can make with it.
    - This is why I always have a goal in mind when teaching R.
    - 
    - My first free course is how to use R just like Excel and get a get from data and then understand tease out more useful information.
    - Let me start by saying, this mini-course is designed for the first time user of R. 

    - I will start off with the scout mindset. See: Julia Graf, TED. 
    - What is the Scout mindset? 
    - Just like the name suggests, Imagine you are a scout. You are a new explorer to this neck of the woods or even city-scape. You are adventurous and interested in what is around.
    - We all have moments like this.
    - There are times when we are outside the comfort of the fort and enjoying the surroundings.

Much like your own car, Most of us know how to drive it. Most of us do not know the theory behind engineering a car or even how to fix it when you are on the side of the road.

However, we all expect our cars to do certain things, accelerate when you press the gas pedal and steer in the direction we want to go.

R has been around for a 25-30 years. That's fine . But what does this mean? It means that over time many people have made additions to the BASE package. I believe in learning in steps. Learn the basics (or BASE package) first. Then move to packages that have that add more functionality. I have found that it is common to find more functionality can commonly mean more sophistication and details and complications.
    - How old is R? R is ~30(?) years old. 
    - R is like a car. A Ford Model T was a great car. I
