There are four main kinds of Business Analytics:
1. Descriptive, 
2. Diagnostic, 
3. Predictive, 
4. Prescriptive. 

These four types together answer everything a company needs to know- from what’s going on in the company to what solutions to be adopted for optimising the functions.

The four types of analytics are usually implemented in stages and no one type of analytics is said to be better than the other. They are interrelated and each of these offers a different insight. With data being important to so many diverse sectors- from manufacturing to energy grids, most of the companies rely on one or all of these types of analytics. With the right choice of analytical techniques, big data can deliver richer insights for the companies

Before diving deeper into each of these, let’s define the four types of analytics:

1) **Descriptive Analytics**: Describing or summarising data using standard business intelligence tools to better understand what has happened.

2) **Diagnostic Analytics**: Focus on past performance to determine what happened and why. The result of the analysis is often an analytic dashboard.

3) **Predictive Analytics**: Emphasizes on predicting the possible outcome using statistical models and machine learning techniques.

4) **Prescriptive Analytics**: It is a type of predictive analytics that is used to recommend one or more course of action on analyzing the data.

Let’s understand these in a bit more depth.

#### 1. Descriptive Analytics

This can be termed as the simplest form of analytics. The mighty size of big data may be beyond human comprehension and the first stage hence involves crunching the data into understandable chunks. The purpose of this analytics type is just to summarise the findings.

What some people call "advanced analytics" or "business intelligence" is descriptive statistics (arithmetic operations, mean, median, max, percentage...) on existing data.  It is said that 80% of [business analytics](https://www.epcgroup.net/) involves descriptions based on aggregations of past performance. It is an important step to make raw data understandable to stakeholders. Basic statistics make it easy to identify and address the areas of strengths and weaknesses, in order to facilitate strategizing.

The two main techniques involved are data aggregation and data mining.

By mining historical data, companies can understand consumer behavior and engagement that could be helpful in targeted marketing, service improvement. 

The tools used in this phase are Tableau, MS Excel, R, Python, MATLAB, SPSS, STATA, Minitab, etc.

#### 2. Diagnostic Analytics

Diagnostic analytics is used to determine why something happened. It is characterized by techniques such as drill-down, data discovery, data mining and correlations. Diagnostic analytics takes a deeper look at data to understand the root causes of the events. It is helpful in determining what factors and events contributed to the outcome. It commonly uses probabilities, likelihoods, and the distribution of outcomes for the analysis.

For example, using time series data of sales, diagnostic analytics could help understand why sales decreases for a specific year. However, this type of analytics has a limited ability to give actionable insights. It just provides an understanding of causal relationships and sequences while looking backward.

A few techniques that uses diagnostic analytics include attribute importance, principle components analysis, sensitivity analysis, and conjoint analysis. Training algorithms for classification and regression also fall in this type of analytics

#### 3. Predictive Analytics

Predictive analytics can be is used to help predict future outcomes. However, it is important to note that it cannot predict if an event will occur in the future; it merely forecasts what are the probabilities of the occurrence of the event. A predictive model builds on the preliminary descriptive analytics stage to derive the possibility of the outcomes.

The goal of Predictive Analytics is to devise models from existing data in order to be understand and extrapolate to future events.

One common application of predictive analytics is found in sentiment analysis where all the opinions posted on social media are collected and analyzed to predict the person’s sentiment on a particular subject as being- positive, negative or neutral (future prediction).

Hence, predictive analytics includes building and validation of models that provide accurate predictions. Predictive analytics relies on machine learning algorithms like random forests, SVM, etc. and statistics for learning and testing the data. Usually, companies need trained data scientists and machine learning experts for building these models. The most popular tools for predictive analytics include Python, R, RapidMiner, etc.

If the model is properly tuned, it can be used to support complex forecasts in sales and marketing.

#### 4. Prescriptive Analytics

Predictive analytics goes beyond the three afore mentioned analysises and should suggest future solutions. It can suggest all favorable outcomes according to a specified course of action and also suggest various course of actions to get to a particular outcome. Hence, it uses a strong feedback system that constantly learns and updates the relationship between the action and the outcome.

The computations include optimisation of some functions that are related to the desired outcome. For example, while calling for a cab online, the application uses GPS to connect you to the correct driver from among a number of drivers found nearby. Hence, it optimises the distance for faster arrival time. Recommendation engines also use prescriptive analytics.

The other approach includes simulation where all the key performance areas are combined to design the correct solutions. It makes sure whether the key performance metrics are included in the solution. The optimisation model will further work on the impact of the previously made forecasts. Because of its power to suggest favorable solutions, prescriptive analytics is the final frontier of advanced analytics or data science, in today’s term.

#### Conclusion

The four types of analytics (Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, Prescriptive) may seem best implemented sequentially. However, in most scenarios, companies can jump directly to prescriptive analytics. As for most of the companies, they are aware of or are already implementing descriptive analytics but if one has identified the key area that needs to be optimised and worked upon, they must employ prescriptive analytics to reach the desired outcome.

According to research, prescriptive analytics is still at the budding stage and not many firms have completely used its power. However, the advancements in predictive analytics will surely pave the way for its development. Hope this article gave you a better understanding of the analytics spectrum.
