## What is R?

1. The [R-Project](https://cran.r-project.org/index.html) is a freely available, open-source language and environment for statistical computing.  
   * https://cran.r-project.org/
   * R-Archive contains over **18,000** packages: *scientific, graphical, linear and nonlinear modelling, statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, and clustering* libraries.
   * For history see: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)).

2. R can be used with MS Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.
   * The *most commonly used IDE* is **RStudio** at [Rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). 

3. Microsoft purchased the rights to use R in 2015 and uses it heavily.
   * [Microsoft R Open](https://mran.microsoft.com/open) has [multithreaded support](https://mran.microsoft.com/rro#intelmkl1), as well as support for Windows and Linux-based platforms.
   * R is used by Kaggle, Google, Twitter, Facebook, Microsoft, Uber, [example article](https://www.listendata.com/2016/12/companies-using-r.html).
 
4. For R Help:

## What is Base R?

Much like Python, R has a minimal set of commands that it can carry out.

Here are **2 R-cheat-sheets** that I happen to like.

1. [R Commands Summary](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/courses/s141/RNotes.pdf)
2. [A short list of some useful R commands](https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~stevel/251/comR.pdf)
