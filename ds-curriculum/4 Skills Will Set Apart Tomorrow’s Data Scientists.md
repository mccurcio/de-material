Skilled data scientists are in demand.
Certain skills will make them indispensable.

The pandemic accelerated the adoption of data-driven strategies across industries. In retail, companies like Target turned to IoT and location data to inform their [drive-up shopping strategies](https://wwd.com/business-news/business-features/target-pandemic-retail-winner-1234719937/), simplifying the shopping experience and driving revenue in a tough year for brick-and-mortar retailers. Healthcare [pivoted entirely](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/vast-majority-of-hospitals-say-they-have-an-ai-strategy-up-from-just-half/596412), turning to data-driven insights to remain agile and responsive amid shifting medical supplies, filled ER beds, health screenings and other challenges. The financial services industry has utilized data for years to inform business strategies and solve emerging challenges.

While data is an advantage now, in the future, it’ll be the foundation of all business. Data science will be a commonplace skill (and potentially a required one) beyond engineering and IT roles. To stay competitive, data scientists should invest in learning how to best translate data into actionable insights and compelling stories that will resonate across their business. These four skills will be critical to their success:

**1. Communicating Probability, Statistics, and Other Branches of Mathematics**

The widening data numeracy and business intelleigence gap threatens innovation and collaboration across teams. [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/technology/human-impact-data-literacy#:~:text=Improve%20employees'%20self%2Dconfidence%20to,trusted%20to%20make%20better%20decisions) found that 75% of employees read data, yet only 21% “are confident with their data literacy skills.” 

Organizations should invest in data literacy across the entire organization to boost productivity. Today’s data scientists need to learn how to best communicate the fundamentals _behind_ data.

The ability to explain different concepts like variance, standard deviation, and distributions will help data scientists explain:
1. How data was collected, 
2. What the set of data reveals about that data, and 
3. Whether it appears valid. 

These insights are helpful when communicating data to stakeholders, and the C-suite. 
With these fundamentals, you can easily explain the _how_ behind data: 
- How did you come up with these numbers? 
- How do we know they’re valid and representative?

During these discussions, avoid technicalities. The best data scientists value simplicity. Complexity is added only as needed. To brush up on these concepts, check out offerings at online learning institutions and universities. 
- [Harvard University](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/subject/statistics) offers free online courses on topics like probability, as do popular e-learning platforms like
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/compstats/).

**2. Making Data Understandable**

The best data scientists are adept storytellers. 

The ability to tell a story about data is related to the ability to simplify and explain the technicalities details. Stories are innately more human than large swaths of numbers: One [study](https://mannerofspeaking.org/2009/10/13/making-it-stick-tell-stories/) found that 63% of an audience remembered stories when listening to speeches, but only 5% could recall just one statistic.

Data Scienitsts provide the necessary context about data sets and explain its importance in the larger picture. When sharing a data set or results of a data project, focus on crafting a narrative with the **top three ideas** the audience understand. Reiterate these points throughout whatever medium you choose. This makes new information easily digestible and actionable.

**3. Visualizing Data to Make an Impact**

Visual mediums are a compelling but often undervalued way to communicate data. Consider the different types of graphs and charts examining various data sets for the pandemic. From [maps tracking vaccine rollouts](about:blank) to [Johns Hopkins’ collection of pandemic-related graphs](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html), data visualization has proven to be a critical way to interact with and understand data.

The best visuals explain and contextualize large volumes of data, allowing viewers (especially non-technical stakeholders) to quickly digest information and spot key takeaways that may have been buried in the raw data. For data visualization, there are tools like Redash to create charts and graphs. For developing interactive maps, sign up for [beginner seminars](https://www.usnews.com/education/learn-data-visualization-guide) that teach data visualization with Python and other software. For creative inspiration -- books like Nadieh Bremer and Shirley Wu’s “[Data Sketches](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Sketches-AK-Peters-Visualization-dp-0367000083/dp/0367000083/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=),” following the [work of Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/), or [Tableau’s Public Gallery](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/gallery/?tab=viz-of-the-day&type=viz-of-the-day) can spark new ideas.

**4. Balancing Learning and Teaching**

Tomorrow’s best data scientists will be both teachers and students. Find ways to build learning and experimentation into your everyday routine, reading the latest news on data techniques, or try a new software program. These approaches can showcase your value within an organization. They also offer a helpful perspective: Knowing how to approach information can improve how you share insights with others.

As more companies turn to data-driven insights to make smart business decisions, data scientists will take on more significant responsibilities within organizations. Conducting cutting-edge data science is only half the battle. Knowing how to explain your process and present findings in an engaging way will make tomorrow’s leading data scientists indispensable.
