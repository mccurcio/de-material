  <h2 align="center">Data Science Practitioner's Reading List</h2>
</p>

**Note:** This opinoinated list is by [Matthew Curcio](). It includes material on data science, machine learning books, websites, videos, etc. that I have found useful *and* would recommend. It is **NOT** *complete nor comprehensive* but simply a resource for myself and others. 

- If you would like to **add or correct**, please make a pull request. I am on the look out for classic papers too...
 
:star: Many sections are still **Under Construction**
