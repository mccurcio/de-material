**Note To All:** This opinoinated list is by [Matthew Curcio](). It includes material on data science, machine learning books, websites, videos, etc. that I have found useful *and* would recommend. It is **NOT** *complete or comprehensive* but simply a resource for myself and others. 

- If you would like to add or correct an area please make a pull request. I am on the look out for classic papers...
