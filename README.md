  <h2 align="center">Data Science Practitioner's Reading List</h2>
</p>

**Note:** This opinoinated list is by [Matthew Curcio](https://mcc1.netlify.app/). It includes material on data science, machine learning books, websites, videos, etc. that I have found useful *and* would recommend. It is **NOT** *complete nor comprehensive* but simply a resource for myself and others.
