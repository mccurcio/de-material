# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Adding something to the list

If you want to add a book or article to this list, make sure it is:

1. either something you've read and enjoyed, recommended, and
2. it is about Data Science related or developer soft skills

I appreciate that D.S. can use many different languages but I *strictly* want to focus on Python 3, R, and Machine learning and all related technologies. This is something that I would have benefited from when I started so I want to make sure those who struggle with D.S. have a resource.

If you have something to contribute, please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/mccurcio/ds/pulls).

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of an awesome list will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-* list guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
