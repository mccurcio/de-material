## Adding Something

If you want to add a book, article, or resource make sure it is:

1. Try and make sure it is Free!
2. It must be something you have read and enjoyed. This is not repor for every and all hints and ideas.
3. I would like to focus on tutorials that are easy to follow and explicit.

I find many people's writing is not concise. Therefore I would like to make this a *"no bs"* site.

This means *KISS*. For me, KISS <- **Keep It Simple and Short**.

This is something that I would have benefited from and a resource that is current for any level of student.
