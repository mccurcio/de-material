## Adding something to this list

If you want to add a book, article, etc. to this list, make sure it is:

1. either something you've read and enjoyed, recommended, and
2. it is on topic or developer soft skills.

This is something that I would have benefited from and a resource that is current for any level of student.

If you have something to contribute, please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/mccurcio/ds/pulls).
